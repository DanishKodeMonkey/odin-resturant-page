# Odin resturant page

## An exercise in creating an app using node and webpack.

Time to practice them webpacking skills!
With some bonus practice in DOM manipulaation.

## The goal

The end goal being that the page should be generated using javascript alone!
<sub>although CSS files are allowed for styling</sub>
and bundle it up neatly using webpack!

In the end I should have a solid grasp on the usage of the node package manager, webpack, webpack configuration, package management, and have a production layout.

That and freshing up on the DOM manipulation skills is always welcome

# Project status

Still in the works
