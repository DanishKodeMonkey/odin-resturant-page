# Odin resturant page

## An exercise in creating an app using node and webpack.

Time to practice them webpacking skills!
With some bonus practice in DOM manipulaation.

The end goal being that the page should be generated using javascript alone!
<sub>although CSS files are allowed for styling</sub>
and bundle it up neatly using webpack!
